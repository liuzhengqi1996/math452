\chapter*{Preface}
This monograph is devoted to mathematical descriptions of deep neural
networks. 

This set of notes are based on three courses that I have taught at Penn
State:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction to Deep Learning, Fall 2017 (?)
\item Deep Learning, Spring 2019
\item Introduction to Deep Learning, Summer 2019
\end{enumerate}
These courses are mainly accessible to undergraduate students from
different colleges and department. 

The audience of this notes are those who are knowledgeable for
\begin{enumerate}
\item Multivariable calculus
\item Linear algebra
\end{enumerate}

who have
taken course on multivariable
