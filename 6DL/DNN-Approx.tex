In this chapter, we will introduce some basic property of approximation theory and analyze the approximation property for some activation functions.

 
	The adaptive FEM we have studied before is indeed using linear
	subspaces. For a given and fixed basis, select the best n term to
	approximate a function. The non-linear approximation theory (by
	DeVore) is to relax the smoothness of function to achieve the optimal
	rate $n^{-1/d}$ but won't improve the rate.
