# Ch2 Linear Machine Learning Models
In this chapter, we will mainly consider two statistic models, namely
logistic regression for linearly separable sets, and support vector
machine (SVM). These two linear models form the foundation of deep
learning, since the final fully connected output layer of a deep neural
network is often given by one of these two linear classifiers. One main
objective in this chapter is that these linear classification models can
be used to classify a collection of linearly separable classes.

In the presentation of this chapter, we treat both logistic regression
and support vector machine as pure mathematical techniques for linearly
separable sets. In the later chapters, we will relate these techniques
in the context of machine learning, especially deep learning.
