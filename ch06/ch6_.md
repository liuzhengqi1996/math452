# Chapter 6 Finite Element Method 




Finite element method is a classic numerical method for solving partial
differential equations. In this chapter, we will give a brief
introduction to this method. discuss its basic properties and error
estimates. In later chapters, we will show that the neural network
functions can be viewed as an extension of finite element function. In
this chapter, we discuss the classical linear finite element spaces, the
error estimate of the finite element method and adaptivity method to
improve the approximation. For shape-regular mesh, we will establish
both the upper and lower bound of the approximation error.
